## Getting started with AnsibleÔÉÅ
Ansible automates the management of remote systems and controls their desired state.

Most Ansible environments have three main components:

- Control node
A system on which Ansible is installed. You run Ansible commands such as ansible or ansible-inventory on a control node.

- Inventory
A list of managed nodes that are logically organized. You create an inventory on the control node to describe host deployments to Ansible.

- Managed node
A remote system, or host, that Ansible controls.
