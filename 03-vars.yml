# We can also give variables from command line interface using -e option [ Extra variable]
# $ansible-playbook 03-vars.yml -e URL=cli.google.com
#In this case the values of URL is replaced with cli variable i.e cli.google.com at all levels [ Play,Tast and Role]
# If the same variable name comes in different locations then precedence will come.
# 1. CLI variable
# 2. Task variable
# 3. Role variable
# 4. Play variable

#If there is no value for a variable then defaults comes into picture
  #defaults/         #
  #main.yml      #  <-- default lower priority variables for this role

# Variables are now three types

# 1. Normal
# vars:
#   URL: example.com

# 2. List
# vars:
#   URLS:
#     - app1.example.com
#     - app2.example.com
# {{ URLS[0] }}

# 3. Map
# vars
#   URLS:
#     app1: app1.example.com
#     app2: app2.example.com
#{{ URLS.app1 }}

# Variable also have data types
# 1. String
# 2. Number
# 3. Boolean ( True/False , Yes/No, )

## Up to now we have seen the user defined variables, where as ansible determines the system config and make those variables available for you to use.
# Those are called as facts
